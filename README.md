# DENSE MODEL DEMONSTRATION

This is a fully built HLS4ML Project and Accelerator Wrapper for a Convolutional Neural Network. The Neural Network kernel files were generated from running Notebook 6 of the HLS4ML Tutorial. Specifically, the Quantized and Pruned version of the CNN is used. The notebook is available at the following link:

Run the project with:
```bash
./host
```
